# Cash register

A program that calculates the change that the customer should receive.

* The user can only enter numbers and a dot.
* The user can enter characters from the keyboard or use the buttons on the cash register.
* If the user makes a mistake, he can use the "c" button to delete the entered number or the Backspace button on the keyboard.
* Initially, the words "Change:" and "Enter the total amount due:" appear on the cash register display. This is the price that the customer should pay.
* When the user enters the number, the character string disappears and the number appears. If it has more than two decimal places, the program rounds this number to have only two decimal places.
* After pressing the "Amount paid" button,  inscription "Enter the amount paid:" will appear. This is the amount that the customer gave to the cashier.
* After pressing the "Count" button, the program calculates the change that should be received by the customer and displayed on the cash register. Next to banknotes and coins, the number of items to be reported is displayed. Those that should be given turn red and the others don't change.
* After entering the next number, the program resets and inscription "Change:" and "Enter the total amount due:" appear again. Numbers of notes and coins disappear, and all subtitles become black.
* If the customer has paid less than he should, the message "Missing:" and the missing amount will be displayed.
* If the user doesn't enter any number and press the "Count" button, it will be moved to the beginning and prompted and re-entered the amount.
